## General 
Introduction about my game 
I've made a quiz game based on art and to test your knowledge to see if you really know about your art!
The start of the home page includes an introduction, explaination about what to expect before you click the start button

After clicking the start button, it dives straight into the game setting the timer off

Once an option has been selected, it will reveal the correct answer based on the colours.
A number is also displayed to show what number question yopu are on beside the quiz.
The next button will also appear.

If you don't pick an option to answer and the timer runs out, it will reveal what the correct answer is.

Once you make it through ten questions, a result button will show.

Once clicked, the results are revealed to show how many you got correct

I've also included two choices that can be made here. Either you can take the quiz game or leave it.

I also managed to include a cool little trick where you hover your mouse over the buttons, it will change colours.

## Deployment 
My project was deployed by using the Github pages.

In order to get this done, here are the steps:

Firstly, go to the menu, and click the preffered repository

Click the settings button which can be easily identified by the gear icon in the menu right hand side.

On the left hand side, scroll down until pages are seen in the Code and automation.

In the build and deployment section, click the Branch and a dropdown menu will appear, and chose the main branch

Click save after this step and a confirmation of deployment should be confirmed shortly.

To know this, a green colored box with message is received saying "Your site is published at" with a web address. My website is live at : https://shaunadoo97.github.io/Second-Portfolio-ArtQuiz-/

## Bugs and Issues

Whilist working on my project, I had encountered so many bugs and issues in this project. I managed to solve them by asking my mentor for help, through research and YouTube what are the possible problems. 
Here are some Bugs and Issues I had to deal with:

Before pressing click to play, I had recieved an error where I did not define button as shown in the inspect section

<img src="assets/documentation/undefined_button.png">

I quickly resolved by fixing a simple mistake to declare it here.

Originally I had set the code to have Questions out of Current Questions being displayed at the bottom but decided to change it but I did have an issue.
It was coming up as "Objects"

<img src="assets/documentation/queno_err.png">

I realised I didn't put in the right question value 

<img src="assets/documentation/quueno_solve.png">

It wasn't showing as objects anymore.

Another huge issue I had was the userScore. Everytime a right answer was selected, it dubilcates in the consol.log.
