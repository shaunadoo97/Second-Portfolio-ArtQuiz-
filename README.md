## Deployment 
My project was deployed by using the Github pages.

In order to get this done, here are the steps:

Firstly, go to the menu, and click the preffered repository

Click the settings button which can be easily identified by the gear icon in the menu right hand side.

On the left hand side, scroll down until pages are seen in the Code and automation.

In the build and deployment section, click the Branch and a dropdown menu will appear, and chose the main branch

Click save after this step and a confirmation of deployment should be confirmed shortly.

To know this, a green colored box with message is received saying "Your site is published at" with a web address. My website is live at : https://shaunadoo97.github.io/Second-Portfolio-ArtQuiz-/

## Additional Notes

unfortunately I did find Javascript a bit difficult and it took me a while to understand just how the functionalty works but with the limited time given, I wasm't able to do it in a way i wanted it done. I hope to come back to this and improve as much as I can.
